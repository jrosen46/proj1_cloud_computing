Number of threads: 1

Extra file open flags: 0
128 files, 64Mb each
8Gb total file size
Block size 4Kb
Number of random requests for random IO: 0
Read/Write ratio for combined random IO test: 1.50
Periodic FSYNC enabled, calling fsync() each 100 requests.
Calling fsync() at the end of test, Enabled.
