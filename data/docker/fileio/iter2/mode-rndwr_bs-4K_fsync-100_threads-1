sysbench 0.4.12:  multi-threaded system evaluation benchmark

Running the test with following options:
Number of threads: 1

Extra file open flags: 0
128 files, 64Mb each
8Gb total file size
Block size 4Kb
Number of random requests for random IO: 0
Read/Write ratio for combined random IO test: 1.50
Periodic FSYNC enabled, calling fsync() each 100 requests.
Calling fsync() at the end of test, Enabled.
Using synchronous I/O mode
Doing random write test
Threads started!
Time limit exceeded, exiting...
Done.

Operations performed:  0 Read, 100 Write, 71 Other = 171 Total
Read 0b  Written 400Kb  Total transferred 400Kb  (3.302Kb/sec)
    0.83 Requests/sec executed

Test execution summary:
    total time:                          121.1384s
    total number of events:              100
    total time taken by event execution: 0.0007
    per-request statistics:
         min:                                  0.00ms
         avg:                                  0.01ms
